## Purpose
When applying to multiple graduate schools, writing individualized application letters can be time-consuming. This tool simplifies the process by:
- Using a single Word template (`application_template.docx`) with placeholders for `University Name` and `Program Name`.
- Reading a list of universities and programs from an Excel file (`application_list.xlsx`).
- Generating customized Word and PDF files for each university-program combination.

By automating this task, you save significant time and effort while ensuring consistency and accuracy in your application materials.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuexi-cao/university-application-generator.git
   cd university-application-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl docxtpl docx2pdf
   ```

3. **Prepare Input Files**:
   - Place your Word template in `data/application_template.docx`.
   - Update the Excel file `data/application_list.xlsx` with your target universities and programs.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the Python script to generate the application letters:
   ```bash
   python code/generate_applications.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Edit the Template**:
   - Open `data/application_template.docx` and customize the content to match your personal story.
   - Ensure the placeholders `University Name` and `Program Name` are present.

2. **Update the Excel File**:
   - In `data/application_list.xlsx`, list the universities in the first column and their corresponding programs in the next three columns.
   - Leave empty cells if a university has fewer than three programs.

3. **Generate Files**:
   - Run the script to generate Word files in `result/word_files` and PDF files in `result/pdf_files`.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:
- `openpyxl`: For reading the Excel file.
- `docxtpl`: For filling the Word template.
- `docx2pdf`: For converting Word files to PDF (Windows only).

Install them using:
```bash
pip install openpyxl docxtpl docx2pdf
```
